# Test-Game-3D

Just a program I am writing out of boredom and a desire to learn some new skills specifically about game development.
This repo is essentially a fork of my Test-Game, but this one will focus on 3D graphics instead of 2D.

## What I've Learned

So far I've learned a bit about game libraries and ways to handle game input. Also some common game practices for movement and actions.
